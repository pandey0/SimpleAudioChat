# SimpleAudioChat

SimpleAudioChat is a basic audio chat application developed in Python. It features a client-server architecture that enables users to engage in audio communication. The graphical user interface (GUI) is built using the tkinter library, and audio streaming is facilitated by the PyAudio library.

## Key Features

1. **Client-Server Architecture:**
   - The application follows a straightforward client-server model. Users can run the server to host audio communication, and clients can connect to the server to participate in the chat.

2. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**
   - The tkinter library is employed to create an intuitive and user-friendly GUI. The GUI includes controls for starting and stopping the server, making it accessible for users without extensive technical knowledge.

3. **Audio Streaming:**
   - PyAudio is utilized to manage the audio streaming process. This enables real-time communication between clients and the server.

4. **Basic Broadcasting:**
   - The application supports basic broadcasting functionality, allowing messages to be broadcasted to multiple clients simultaneously.

## Usage
1. **Run Server:**
   - Run `AudioChatServerGUI.exe` to start the server.

2. **Run Client:**
   - Run `AudioChatClientGUI.exe` to connect to the server and start an audio chat.
