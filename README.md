SimpleAudioChat
SimpleAudioChat is a basic audio chat application developed in Python. It features a client-server architecture that enables users to engage in audio communication. The graphical user interface (GUI) is built using the tkinter library, and audio streaming is facilitated by the PyAudio library.

Key Features
Client-Server Architecture:

The application follows a straightforward client-server model. Users can run the server to host audio communication, and clients can connect to the server to participate in the chat.
Graphical User Interface (GUI):

The tkinter library is employed to create an intuitive and user-friendly GUI. The GUI includes controls for starting and stopping the server, making it accessible for users without extensive technical knowledge.
Audio Streaming:

PyAudio is utilized to manage the audio streaming process. This enables real-time communication between clients and the server.
Basic Broadcasting:

The application supports basic broadcasting functionality, allowing messages to be broadcasted to multiple clients simultaneously.
